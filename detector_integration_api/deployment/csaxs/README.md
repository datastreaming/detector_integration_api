# cSAXS Eiger 9M detector integration

The following README is useful for controlling the Eiger 9M deployment at cSAXS.

The detector integration is made up from the following components:

- Detector integration API (running on xbl-daq-27)
    - https://github.com/datastreaming/detector_integration_api
- Detector client (running on xbl-daq-27)
    - https://github.com/slsdetectorgroup/slsDetectorPackage
- Backend server (running on xbl-daq-28)
    - https://git.psi.ch/HPDI/dafl-eiger
- Writer process (running on xbl-daq-27)
    - https://git.psi.ch/babic_a/cpp_h5_writer

# Controlling the Detector Integration API (DIA)

**DIA Address:** http://xbl-daq-27:10000

To get a feeling on how to use the DIA, you can use the following example to start and write a test file.

You can control the DIA via the Python client or over the REST api directly.

**More documentation about the DIA can be found on its repository** (referenced above).

**Note**: The writer needs a lot of parameters to write the MX file format. You probably do not care about this, so you 
can use the DEBUG_FORMAT_PARAMETERS parameters for now.

## Python client

To use the Python client you need to source our central Python:
```bash
source /opt/gfa/python
```
or you can install it using conda:
```bash
conda install -c paulscherrerinstitute detector_integration_api
```

```python
# Just some mock value for the file format.
DEBUG_FORMAT_PARAMETERS = {

}

# Import the client.
from detector_integration_api import DetectorIntegrationClient

# Connect to the Eiger 9M DIA.
client = DetectorIntegrationClient("http://xbl-daq-27:10000")

# Make sure the status of the DIA is initialized.
client.reset()

# Write 1000 frames, as user id 11057 (gac-x12saop), to file "/sls/X12SA/Data10/gac-x12saop/tmp/dia_test.h5".
writer_config = {"n_frames": 1000, "user_id": 11057, "output_file": "/sls/X12SA/Data10/gac-x12saop/tmp/dia_test.h5"}

# Expect 1000, 16 bit frames.
backend_config = {"bit_depth": 16, "n_frames": 1000}

# Acquire 1000, 16 bit images with a period of 0.02.
detector_config = {"dr": 16, "frames": 1000, "period": 0.02}

# Add format parameters to writer. In this case, we use the debugging one.
writer_config.update(DEBUG_FORMAT_PARAMETERS)

# Set the configs.
client.set_config(writer_config=writer_config, backend_config=backend_config, detector_config=detector_config)

# Start the acquisition.
client.start()

# Get the current acquisition status (it should be "IntegrationStatus.RUNNING")
client.get_status()

# Block until the acquisition has finished (this is optional).
client.wait_for_status("IntegrationStatus.FINISHED")

```

## Direct calls to the REST Api

The direct calls to the REST Api will be shown with cURL. 

Responses from the server are always JSONs. The "state" attribute in the JSON response is:

- **"ok"**: The server processed your request successfully
    - Response example: {"state": "ok", "status": "IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED"}
- **"error"**: An error happened on the server. The field **"status"** will tell you what is the problem.
    - Response example: {"state": "error", "status": "Specify config JSON with 3 root elements..."}

**Note**: Most of the writer parameters in the **config** calls are just for the file format. Only the first 3 are 
important right now:

- n_frames (10 in this example)
- output_file (/sls/X12SA/Data10/gac-x12saop/tmp/dia_test.h5 in this example)
- user_id (11057: gac-x12saop in this example)

**Tip**: You can get a user id by running:
```bash
# Get the id for user gac-x12saop
id -u gac-x12saop
```

```bash
# Make sure the status of the DIA is initialized.
curl -X POST http://xbl-daq-27:10000/api/v1/reset

# Write 1000 frames, as user id 11057 (gac-x12saop), to file "/sls/X12SA/Data10/gac-x12saop/tmp/dia_test.h5".
curl -X PUT http://xbl-daq-27:10000/api/v1/config -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '

# Deployment information

In this section we will describe the current deployment, server by server.

# xbl-daq-28 (Backend server)
On xbl-daq-28 we are running the backend server. The backend is listening on address:

- **http://xbl-daq-28:8080**

It is run using a **systemd** service (/etc/systemd/system/detector_backend.service). 

The services invokes the startup file **/home/dbe/start_dbe.sh**.

The service can be controlled with the following commands (using sudo or root):
- **systemctl start detector\_backend.service** (start the backend)
- **systemctl stop detector\_backend.service** (stop the backend)
- **journalctl -u detector\_backend.service -f** (check the backend logs)

# xbl-daq-27 (DIA and writer server)
On xbl-daq-27 we are running the detector integration api. The DIA is listening on address:

- **http://xbl-daq-27:10000**

It is run using a **systemd** service (/etc/systemd/system/dia.service). 

The services invokes the startup file **/home/dia/start_dia.sh**.

The service can be controlled with the following commands (using sudo or root):
- **systemctl start dia.service** (start the backend)
- **systemctl stop dia.service** (stop the backend)
- **journalctl -u dia.service -f** (check the dia logs)

## Writer
The writer is spawn on request from the DIA. To do that, DIA uses the startup file **/home/dia/start_writer.sh**.

Each time the writer is spawn, a separate log file is generated in **/var/log/h5_zmq_writer/**.

# State machine

The table below describes the possible states of the integration and the methods that cause a transition 
(this are also the methods that are allowed for a defined state).

Methods that do not modify the state machine are not described in this table, as they can be executed in every state.

| State | State description | Transition method | Next state |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED | Integration ready for configuration. |||
| | | set_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | set_last_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | update_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | stop | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED | Acquisition configured. |||
| | | start | IntegrationStatus.RUNNING |
| | | set_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | set_last_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | update_config | IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED |
| | | stop | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| IntegrationStatus.RUNNING | Acquisition running. |||
| | | stop | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| IntegrationStatus.DETECTOR_STOPPED | Waiting for backend and writer to finish. |||
| | | stop | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| IntegrationStatus.FINISHED | Acquisition completed. |||
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| IntegrationStatus.ERROR | Something went wrong. |||
| | | stop | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |
| | | reset | IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED |

A short summary would be:

- You always need to configure the integration before starting the acquisition.
- You cannot change the configuration while the acquisition is running or there is an error.
- The stop method can be called in every state, but it stop the acquisition only if it is running.
- Whatever happens, you have the reset method that returns you in the initial state.
- When the detector stops sending data, the status is DETECTOR_STOPPED. Call STOP to close the backend and stop the 
writing.
- When the detector stops sending data, the backend and writer have completed, 
the status is FINISHED.
