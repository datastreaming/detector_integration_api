# Integration REST API
REST API for integrating beamline software with the detector, backend, and writer.

## Deployed instances
This section is dedicated for the discussion of specific deployment instances, when there is some custom behaviour not 
described in the general documentation above.

### cSAXS Eiger 9M
In this section we will discuss only specific differences for the cSAXS Eiger 9M integration.

#### Integration status
When calculating the integration status, we must take into account all 3 components of our system:

- Detector status: "idle", "running"
- Backend status: "INITIALIZED", "CONFIGURED", "OPEN"
- Writer status: (is_running) True False

The status interpretation code is the following:
```python
from detector_integration_api.manager import IntegrationStatus

def interpret_status(writer, backend, detector):

    if writer is False and detector == "idle" and backend == "INITIALIZED":
        return IntegrationStatus.INITIALIZED

    elif writer is False and detector == "idle" and backend == "CONFIGURED":
        return IntegrationStatus.CONFIGURED

    elif writer is True and detector == "running" and backend == "OPEN":
        return IntegrationStatus.RUNNING

    return IntegrationStatus.ERROR
```

#### Detector configuration
The mandatory attributes for the detector configuration are:

- *"period"*: Period of time (in seconds) for each frame.
- *"frames"*: Number of frames to acquire.
- *"exptime"*: Exposure time (in seconds).
- *"dr"*: Dynamic range - number of bits (16, 32 etc.)

In addition, any attribute that the detector supports can be passed here. Please refer to the detector manual for a 
complete list and explanation of the attributes.

An example of a valid detector config:
```json
{
  "period": 0.1,
  "frames": 1000,
  "exptime": 0.02,
  "dr": 32
}
```

#### Backend configuration
Available and at the same time mandatory backend attributes:

- *"bit_depth"*: Dynamic range - number of bits (16, 32 etc.)
- *"n_frames"*: Number of frames per acquisition.

**Warning**: Please note that this 2 attributes must match the information you provided to the detector:

- (backend) bit_depth == (detector) dr
- (backend) frames == (detector) n_frames

If this is not the case, the configuration will fail.

#### Writer configuration
Due to the data format used for the cSAXS acquisition, the writer configuration is quite large. It is divided into 2 
parts:

- Writer related config (config used by the writer itself to write the data to disk)
- cSAXS file format config (config used to write the file in the cSAXS format)

An example of a valid writer config would be:
```json

}
```

#### Writer related config
To configure the writer, you must specify:

- *"output\_file"*: Location where the file will be written.
- *"user\_id"*: User to write the writer process under.
- *"group\_id"*: Group to write the writer process under.

In addition to this properties, a valid config must also have the parameters needed for the cSAXS file format.

#### cSAXS file format config

The following fields are required to write a valid cSAXS formated file. 
On the right side is the path inside the HDF5 file where the value will be stored.
